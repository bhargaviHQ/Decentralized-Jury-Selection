## Project Overview:
The research work folder contains the files that have been used in the experiment conducted for the thesis on Fair and Representative Jury Selection Procedure. The folder includes the algorithms, metrics, and synthetic datasets generated to test the algorithms. Additionally, real datasets, such as Ethereum data, have been extracted, and experiments have been run to test the efficiency of the algorithm in terms of fairness and representation using the metrics.
Please refer to the below-mentioned folders for specific files.

## Folder Structure:

- **/algorithms:** Contains implementation of the Fair-Spread family of algorithms code used in the experiments.
- **/metrics:** Includes metrics used to evaluate the performance of the algorithms.
- **/all-experiments:** The folder comprises experiments conducted as part of the thesis research. It's important to note that this list is not exhaustive, and certain configurations may be absent, such as some values for different network variations, jury sizes, or parametric adjustments. Nonetheless, a substantial sample has been included to provide an overview of the experimental methodology.

Please refer to the specific folders for code, algorithms, experiment setup, and datasets. All the code is written using Python; kindly refer to the imports.py file for more information on the libraries used during the experiments.
